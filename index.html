<p>Effective date: 2025-11-17</p>
<p>Thank you for using VigilCam. Your privacy is important. This Privacy
Policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, where
recordings are stored, how you can delete data, and how to contact the
developer.</p>
<p>This is the end-user privacy policy intended to be published for
users. It does not include developer-only notes or Play Console
guidance.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>VigilCam records audio and/or video only when you explicitly start a
recording in the app.</li>
<li>Recordings are saved on your device (app-scoped storage) and are not
uploaded to any server by default.</li>
<li>You can optionally publish a recording to your device’s gallery
(MediaStore); this is a local action that makes the file visible to
other apps on your device.</li>
<li>The app shows a persistent notification while recording and requests
notification permission on Android 13+ to display it.</li>
<li>Automatic backups of user media are disabled for this app.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-the-app-collects">What the app collects</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Audio and Video Recordings
<ul>
<li>Type: Audio and video files produced by the app when you
record.</li>
<li>Source: Captured from your device’s microphone and camera while you
record.</li>
<li>Purpose: To provide the core functionality of creating local
recordings you can review, save, share, or publish to your device’s
gallery.</li>
<li>Storage: Files are stored in app-scoped external storage (for
example, the app’s <code>Movies/</code> and <code>Music/</code>
directories returned by <code>getExternalFilesDir()</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>App Preferences
<ul>
<li>Type: Non-identifying preferences (UI settings, last-used options)
stored locally.</li>
<li>Purpose: To remember your settings and improve the app
experience.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The app does not upload recordings or preferences to any external
servers by default.</p>
<p>Other technical data:</p>
<ul>
<li>This app does not collect analytics, crash reports, advertising
identifiers, or other telemetry. No data is sent to external servers
unless you explicitly share a recording.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="permissions-what-they-are-used-for">Permissions (what they are
used for)</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>CAMERA</code>: Used to capture video during recording sessions
you start.</li>
<li><code>RECORD_AUDIO</code>: Used to capture audio during recording
sessions you start.</li>
<li><code>FOREGROUND_SERVICE</code>: Allows recordings to continue while
the app is backgrounded; a persistent notification is displayed.</li>
<li><code>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</code> (Android 13+): Allows the persistent
recording notification to be shown.</li>
<li><code>WAKE_LOCK</code>: Temporarily keeps the CPU awake so long
recordings are not interrupted when the screen turns off.</li>
<li><code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> (legacy, Android ≤ 9): Only used
on older devices; modern Android uses scoped storage instead.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-recordings-are-handled-and-how-to-delete-them">How
recordings are handled and how to delete them</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Default storage: Recordings are saved in the app’s private
external storage directories (e.g.,
<code>Android/data/&lt;package&gt;/files/Movies</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Publish to gallery: If you choose to publish a recording, the app
copies the file to your device’s gallery (MediaStore) so it is visible
to other apps on your device.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete: Delete recordings using the in-app UI. To remove all app
data, uninstall the app from your device (this removes app-scoped
files). If you published a recording to the gallery, delete it from the
gallery as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete: Delete recordings using the in-app UI. To remove all app
data, uninstall the app from your device (this removes app-scoped
files). If you published a recording to the gallery, delete it from the
gallery as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Retention: Recordings remain on your device until you delete
them. Uninstalling the app removes app-scoped files; if you published a
recording to the gallery, that copy remains until you delete it from the
gallery.</p></li>
<li><p>Temporary files: The app may create temporary files during
recording; these are removed when a recording is finalized or when the
app’s cache is cleared.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>
<ul>
<li>The app disables automatic backups of recorded media. Recorded files
and sensitive preferences are excluded from device backups.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="data-sharing">Data sharing</h2>
<ul>
<li>The app does not transmit recordings to external servers by
default.</li>
<li>If you share a recording via the Android share sheet or publish it
to the gallery, that action makes the file available to other apps on
your device and those apps may transfer or upload it according to their
own functionality.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Files are stored in app-scoped storage to limit access by other
apps.</li>
<li>The app uses <code>FileProvider</code> to securely share files when
required.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="third-party-services">Third-party services</h2>
<ul>
<li>This app does not use third-party analytics, ad networks, or cloud
storage providers. It uses Android Jetpack libraries (WorkManager,
DataStore) and Hilt for local functionality.</li>
</ul>
